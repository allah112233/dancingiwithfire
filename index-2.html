        <h2>Welcome to Dancing With Fire</h2>
        <p>Dancing With Fire is a LITE genealogy rogue game where anyone can be a hero. Every time you die, a descendant will succeed you. Each descendant is unique. Some are colorblind, this is terrifying...</p>

        <h2>Story</h2>
        <p>Adventure in a procedural way. Explore new castles in each life.
            Legacy lite. The characters die, but each death increases the lineage and strengthens it.
            Lots of unique traits that will make each game special. Have you ever wanted to have dyslexia? Now you can!
            More than 8 classes to choose from (specifically 9)! Each class has its own abilities that modify the way it is played.
            More than 60 different enemies to test your skills. I hope you like the chromatic variations!
            Huge expandable skill tree. Accumulate loot to improve the mansion and give your successors an advantage.
            By the way, there's also a blacksmith and an enchantress, but we forgot to put them in the trailer...
            Arm your heroes with powerful weapons and armor. You can also gain new abilities, such as flight, acceleration, and air jumps.
            Secrets and Easter eggs to discover in abundance for... Or maybe it's a lie! No, it's true!
            Do you have command? Play with the controller. Big screen ready.
            Includes clowns.</p>
